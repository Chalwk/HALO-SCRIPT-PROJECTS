## Overview

**Tag**, you're it! This game mode is a fun, fast-paced version of the classic game of tag. It's designed for two or more players and involves a dynamic chase between **runners** and **taggers**. The tagger's job is to tag runners, while the runners try to stay out of reach to accumulate points. A game starts when a player is whacked to become "it" (the tagger). The tagger's turn ends when they either tag their first victim or when the turn time expires. If the tagger fails to tag anyone within the time limit, a random player becomes the new tagger.

### Key Features

- **Runners:** All runners are armed with plasma rifles. This weapon is strategically chosen because it slows down the tagger when fired at.
- **Taggers:** The taggers wield an oddball, and their goal is to tag the runners.
- **Score Accumulation:** Runners accumulate 5 points every 10 seconds.
- **Score Limit:** The game ends when a player reaches the score limit of **10,000 points**.
- **Speed Boost:** Taggers receive a **1.5x speed boost** while runners maintain their normal speed.
- **Tagging Points:** Tagging a runner earns the tagger **500 points**.
- **No Points for Killing:** Runners cannot earn points for killing other players; they only earn points by staying alive and avoiding being tagged.
