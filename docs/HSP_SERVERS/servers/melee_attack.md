## Overview

**Melee Attack** is a high-energy game mode where players are limited to **melee-only combat**. The key feature of this mode is that players instantly kill their opponent by striking them with the **skull**. No guns, no grenades, just pure hand-to-hand action! The game ends when a team or player reaches the **score limit of 50**. Respawn time is **instant**, making for fast-paced, continuous action.
