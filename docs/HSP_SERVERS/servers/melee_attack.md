## üí° Tips for Success

- **Be Quick**: The instant respawn means you can dive back into the action right away, but it also means your enemies
  won't stay down for long.
- **Master the Melee**: Since the only way to score is by striking with the skull, perfecting your melee technique will
  make all the difference.
- **Move Stealthily**: Use the environment and sneak up on opponents to get the first strike in.
