## Overview

**Snipers Dream Team** is a throwback to the good old days, originally created by Skelito circa 2006-2009 - it was a
series of modded maps with custom skins, visual enhancements, and custom portals. This version recreates the core
elements of the classic mod, with explosive snipers, unique game mechanics, and powerful weapons. It's designed for
Capture the Flag (CTF) game types but can be used on any mode. It allows players to enjoy the gameplay without needing
the original modded maps or skins, keeping the classic thrill intact.

### Key Features

- **Explosive Snipers:** Powerful snipers that fire explosive bullets.
- **Rocket Hog Buff:** The rocket hog's weapon is more powerful. Shooting the ground nearby will launch you into the
  air (hogatapult).
- **Weapon & Vehicle Buffs:** Almost all weapons and vehicles have been buffed, with some providing instant kills.
- **Invisible Pistol Bullets:** Pistols can fire invisible bullets when you empty the magazine and do not require
  reloading.
- **Super Grenades:** Grenades are super powerful and can be thrown up to 5x farther than normal.
- **Custom Hidden Teleports:** Each stock map features custom hidden teleports, adding a layer of strategy and surprise.
- **Custom Vehicle Spawn System:** A unique system for spawning vehicles that adds flexibility to gameplay.
