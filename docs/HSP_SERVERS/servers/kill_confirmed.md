## Overview

**Kill Confirmed** is a fast-paced, objective-based game mode inspired by *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*. In this
mode, teams score by collecting dog tags (also called skulls) dropped by enemies upon death. The first team to reach *
*65 points** wins, or the team with the most points when time runs out. Dog tags (skulls) will despawn after **30
seconds** by default, but this can be configured. No points are deducted for suicides, allowing players to focus on
confirming kills without penalty.

### Key Features

- **Score Limit:** First team to 65 points wins.
- **Points on Confirm:** 2 points per dog tag collected.
- **Despawn Time:** Dog tags despawn after 30 seconds, but the time can be configured.
- **Friendly Fire Blocked:** Friendly fire is disabled, so teammates can't steal each other's dog tags.
- **Suicide Penalty:** No points are deducted for suicides.
- **Team Slayer:** This script is designed to run on Team Slayer.
