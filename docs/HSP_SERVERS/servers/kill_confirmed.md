## Overview

**Kill Confirmed** is a fast-paced, objective-based game mode inspired by *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*. In this mode, teams score by collecting dog tags (also called skulls) dropped by enemies upon death. The first team to reach **65 points** wins, or the team with the most points when time runs out. Dog tags (skulls) will despawn after **30 seconds** by default, but this can be configured. No points are deducted for suicides, allowing players to focus on confirming kills without penalty.
