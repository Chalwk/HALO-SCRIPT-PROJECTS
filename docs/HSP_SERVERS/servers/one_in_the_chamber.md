## Overview

**One In The Chamber** is a tense, precision-based game mode where players are equipped with a **pistol and only one
bullet**. Every shot counts, as a single shot can eliminate your opponent. If you miss, you are left with **melee combat
** until you get another kill. For every opponent you eliminate, you are rewarded with **one bullet**. The success of
this mode depends on your combination of **precision, reflexes**, and knowing when to **take the shot** or **close in
for the kill**.

### Key Features

- **Pistol-Only:** Players start with a single bullet in their pistol.
- **Melee Combat on Miss:** If you miss, you must resort to melee combat until you get another kill.
- **Ammo Per Kill:** Successfully eliminating an enemy rewards you with a bullet for your pistol.
- **No Grenades, No Vehicles:** Grenades and vehicles are completely disabled in this mode.
- **Tactical Play:** It's all about precision and timing, you need to know when to shoot and when to close in for a
  melee kill.
