## Overview

**One In The Chamber** is a tense, precision-based game mode where players are equipped with a **pistol and only one bullet**. Every shot counts, as a single shot can eliminate your opponent. If you miss, you are left with **melee combat** until you get another kill. For every opponent you eliminate, you are rewarded with **one bullet**. The success of this mode depends on your combination of **precision, reflexes**, and knowing when to **take the shot** or **close in for the kill**.
