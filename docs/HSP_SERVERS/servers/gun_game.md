## Overview

**Gun Game** is a fast-paced, progression-based game mode inspired by Call of Duty's Gun Game. Players start with a
basic weapon and, with each kill, progress through a set of decreasingly powerful weapons. The game ends when a player
reaches the final weapon and eliminates an opponent with it. Infinite ammo ensures the action never stops, so focus on
leveling up your arsenal!

### Key Features

- **Infinite Ammo:** Never worry about running out of ammo.
- **Progressive Weapon Levels:** Level up by getting kills and advance through a sequence of weapons.
- **Weapon Progression:** Start with basic weapons and unlock stronger ones with each kill.
- **Winning Condition:** Be the first player to reach the final weapon and get a kill with it.
