## Overview

**Gun Game** is a fast-paced, progression-based game mode inspired by Call of Duty's Gun Game. Players start with a basic weapon and, with each kill, progress through a set of decreasingly powerful weapons. The game ends when a player reaches the final weapon and eliminates an opponent with it. Infinite ammo ensures the action never stops, so focus on leveling up your arsenal!
