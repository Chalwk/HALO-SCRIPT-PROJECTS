## Overview

The **Uber Racing** experience combines intense team-based racing with advanced systems. It's not just about
being the fastest driver, it's about teamwork, strategy, and leveraging multiple tactical systems to dominate the race.

  you and automatically enter the driver's seat.

  recovering from wipeouts or coordinating team movements.
* **Deployable Mines:** Place tactical explosives from your vehicle to create defensive traps for pursuing enemies.

* **Advanced Lap Tracking:** Comprehensive system tracks lap times, validates laps, and maintains personal bests and
  all-time map records.
* **Global Rankings:** Weighted point system ranks players across all maps based on performance and records.
* **Massive Vehicle Support:** Extensive vehicle whitelist supporting countless custom maps with proper seat
  configurations.
