## Overview

The **Uber Racing** experience combines intense team-based racing with advanced scripting systems. It's not just about
being the fastest driver, it's about teamwork, strategy, and leveraging the unique "Uber" system to get your entire team
across the finish line.

### Key Features

* **On-Demand Vehicle Spawning:** Type keywords like `hog` or `rhog` in chat to instantly spawn a vehicle in front of
  you and automatically enter the driver's seat.
* **The Uber System:** Use chat commands like `uber` or `taxi` to instantly join a teammate's vehicle. Perfect for
  recovering from wipeouts or coordinating team movements.
* **Advanced Lap Tracking:** The system tracks lap times, validates laps (with minimum time and driver-seat
  requirements), and maintains personal bests and all-time map records.
* **Global Rankings:** A weighted point system ranks players across all maps based on map records, global records,
  performance relative to records, and top finishes.
* **Massive Vehicle Whitelist:** Supports a huge variety of custom vehicles from countless maps, all configured with
  proper seat priorities (Driver, Gunner, Passenger).
* **Team-Based Strategy:** Work with your team to create convoys. Gunners defend against opponents while drivers focus
  on racing. The Uber system makes coordination effortless.
* **Smart Vehicle Management:** Empty vehicles automatically despawn after a delay to maintain map cleanliness and
  performance.
* **In-Game Commands:** Use `stats`, `top`, and `global` commands to view personal bests, map records, and global
  rankings.
