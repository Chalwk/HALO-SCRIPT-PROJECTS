# HSP-Uber Racing

## üìù Overview

The **HSP-Uber Racing** brings intense team-based racing, powered by a suite of advanced scripts. It's not just about
being the fastest driver, it's about teamwork, strategy, and using the unique "Uber" system to get your entire team
across the finish line.

### Key Features:

* **On-Demand Vehicle Spawning:** Type keywords like `hog` or `rhog` in chat to instantly spawn a vehicle right in front
  of you and automatically get in the driver's seat.
* **The Uber System:** The core innovation! Use chat commands like `uber` or `taxi` to instantly join a teammate's
  vehicle. Perfect for getting back in the race after a wipeout or for coordinating assaults.
* **Race Enforcement:** An intelligent assistant ensures everyone is racing. Players who exit their vehicle for too long
  will receive warnings and eventually be penalized to keep the competition fair and focused.
* **Massive Vehicle Whitelist:** Supports a huge variety of custom vehicles from countless maps, all configured with
  proper seat priorities (Driver, Gunner, Passenger).
* **Team-Based Strategy:** Work with your team to create convoys. Gunners can defend against opponents, while drivers
  focus on the road. The Uber system makes coordinating these strategies effortless.
* **Smart Vehicle Cleanup:** Empty vehicles automatically despawn after a delay to keep the map clean and performance
  high.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Spawn a Vehicle:** At the start of the race or after a respawn, type a vehicle keyword (e.g., `hog`) in team chat
   to spawn it.
2. **Call an Uber:** Can't find a vehicle? Look for a teammate who's driving and type `uber`, `taxi`, or `cab` in chat
   to instantly join them in an empty seat.
3. **Drive to Win:** Follow the race checkpoints! Your main goal is to complete laps, but don't forget you can use your
   gunner to slow down opposing teams.
4. **Stay in Your Vehicle:** The Race Assistant will warn you if you're on foot for too long. Re-enter a vehicle quickly
   to avoid penalties!

## üí° Tips for Success

* **Teamwork is Everything:** A well-coordinated team with a driver and a gunner is far more effective than a lone wolf.
  Use the Uber system to stick together.
* **Choose Your Ride Wisely:** Different vehicles have different strengths. A faster Mongoose might be great for solo
  runs, but a Warthog with a gunner is essential for holding a lead under fire.
* **Be a Good Driver:** If you're driving, pay attention to Uber requests from your team. A full vehicle is a powerful
  vehicle.
* **Know the Rules:** Remember the Race Assistant is active. Intentionally leaving your vehicle to bypass parts of the
  track is against the rules and will get you punished.
