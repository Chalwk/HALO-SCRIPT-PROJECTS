## Overview

The **Uber Racing** brings intense team-based racing, powered by a suite of advanced scripts. It's not just about being
the fastest driver, it's about teamwork, strategy, and using the unique "Uber" system to get your entire team across the
finish line.

### Key Features

* **On-Demand Vehicle Spawning:** Type keywords like `hog` or `rhog` in chat to instantly spawn a vehicle right in front
  of you and automatically get in the driver's seat.
* **The Uber System:** The core innovation! Use chat commands like `uber` or `taxi` to instantly join a teammate's
  vehicle. Perfect for getting back in the race after a wipeout or for coordinating assaults.
* **Race Enforcement:** An intelligent assistant ensures everyone is racing. Players who exit their vehicle for too long
  will receive warnings and eventually be penalized to keep the competition fair and focused.
* **Massive Vehicle Whitelist:** Supports a huge variety of custom vehicles from countless maps, all configured with
  proper seat priorities (Driver, Gunner, Passenger).
* **Team-Based Strategy:** Work with your team to create convoys. Gunners can defend against opponents, while drivers
  focus on the road. The Uber system makes coordinating these strategies effortless.
* **Smart Vehicle Cleanup:** Empty vehicles automatically despawn after a delay to keep the map clean and performance
  high.
