## Overview

**EV Jump** is a parkour challenge where players navigate a course full of jumps, ledges, and obstacles. The goal is to complete the course **as quickly as possible**, passing through checkpoints and finishing the run in record time. Success depends on **timing, movement precision, and course knowledge**.

### Key Features

* **Checkpoint System:** Players progress through designated checkpoints.
* **Death Limit & Respawn:** If a player dies too many times, their run resets automatically. Players respawn at the **last checkpoint reached**.
* **Timed Runs:** Completion times are tracked for personal bests, map records, and averages. Top 5 rankings are displayed per map.
* **Visual Aids:** Start/finish lines and checkpoint markers (flags and oddballs) help guide players.
* **Adjustable Speed:** Running speed varies per map.
* **Anti-Camping:** Players cannot linger on checkpoints without progressing, or they will be reset.
* **Persistent Stats:** Player and map stats are saved and persist across games.
