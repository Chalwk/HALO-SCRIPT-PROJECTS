## Overview

**EV Jump** is a fast-paced, precision parkour challenge where players navigate custom-designed courses full of jumps, ledges, and obstacles. The goal is to complete the course **as quickly as possible**, passing through checkpoints and finishing the run in record time. Success depends on **timing, movement precision, and course knowledge**.

### Key Features

* **Checkpoint System:** Players progress through designated checkpoints. Courses can be completed **in order** or **freely**, depending on map settings.
* **Death Limit & Respawn:** If a player dies too many times, their run resets automatically. Players respawn at the **last checkpoint** reached.
* **Timed Runs:** Completion times are tracked for personal bests, map records, and global rankings.
* **Visual Aids:** Start/finish lines and checkpoint markers help guide players through the course.
* **Adjustable Speed:** Running speed can be configured for each map to ensure smooth parkour flow.
