## Overview

The **Rooster CTF** script adds Capture The Flag (CTF) mechanics to Slayer (FFA/Team) game types. A single flag will
spawn in the middle of the map. Players need to return the flag to either the **Red Base** or **Blue Base** to score.

### Key Features

- **Flag Respawn Delay:** 15 seconds until a dropped flag respawns.
- **Capture Radius:** Players must be within 1.1 world units to capture the flag.
- **Respawn Warning Message:** Alerts players when the flag is about to respawn.
- **Capture Message:** Broadcasts when a flag is captured.
- **Pickup Messages:** Team or FFA messages when a player picks up the flag.
- **Flag Capture Points:** Players earn 5 points for capturing a flag.
- **Score Limit:** 50 points.
- **Vehicle Capture:** You can capture a flag while in a vehicle.
