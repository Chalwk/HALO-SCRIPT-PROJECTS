# Halo Script Projects Community Rules

Welcome to the **Halo Script Projects Community Rules**! These guidelines ensure a **positive, productive, and
respectful environment** for all members. By joining and/or contributing, you agree to follow these rules. Violations
may result in warnings, temporary restrictions, or permanent bans.

## Scope & Enforcement

Rules apply to **all members**, including staff and volunteers, across **Discord, GitHub, and the HSP Halo Servers**.
They are enforced to maintain a safe, collaborative, and professional environment. Questions? Ask staff or moderators.

## VPN / Proxy Advisory

The HSP Halo Servers use **IP-based moderation systems**. Using VPNs or proxies can trigger false flags. Avoid
free/shared VPNs. If you believe a ban was accidental (e.g., shared IP), contact staff for review.
