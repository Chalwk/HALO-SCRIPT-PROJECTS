**Bug Reports**
If you encounter a bug, you have two options:

1. Post directly in this channel with a clear description.
    * Include steps to reproduce it, any error messages, and context (e.g., script, map, or game mode).
2. Or, if you prefer a structured approach, use the **Bug Report Form** on GitHub.

**Feature Requests**
Have an idea for a new script feature or improvement? You can:

1. Share it here in this channel.
2. Or, submit it through the **Feature Request Form** on GitHub.

**Submit via GitHub (optional):**

* [Bug Report Form](https://github.com/Chalwk/HALO-SCRIPT-PROJECTS/issues/new?assignees=Chalwk&labels=Bug%2CNeeds+Triage&projects=&template=BUG_REPORT.yaml&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3Ctitle%3E)

:bulb: **Tip:** Be clear and specific in your request! Include details like error messages, what you've tried, and any
scripts or configs involved. This helps others help you faster.
