Tired of the administrative nightmare of managing multiple Halo servers? Struggling with redundant files, inconsistent bans, and wasted disk space? I've formalized the incredibly clever server structure powering the HSP Halo servers into a comprehensive guide!

I am proud to publish **"A Masterclass in Multi-Server Management"** to the HSP GitHub repo. This guide breaks down the architecture that allows me to run 16+ servers with maximum efficiency and minimal hassle.

**What This Guide Covers:**
â€¢   **The "Smart Ban" System:** Ban a player on one server, and they're instantly banned on all.
â€¢   **Unified Administration:** One `admins.txt` to rule them all. No more adding on 16 different servers.
â€¢   **Efficiency:** Drastically reduce disk space usage by eliminating redundant files.
â€¢   **Portability:** Using environment variables for easy maintenance and relocation.
â€¢   **Isolation:** Keep server-specific configs separate while sharing global settings.

This is the exact blueprint I use for my own (HSP) servers. It's a proven, professional-grade system that demonstrates a deep understanding of SAPP and Halo's dedicated server.
