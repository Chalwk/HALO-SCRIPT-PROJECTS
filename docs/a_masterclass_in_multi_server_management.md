# HSP Halo Servers: A Masterclass in Multi-Server Management

This document outlines the sophisticated server architecture powering our 16 Halo SAPP servers (8 Halo Custom Edition and 8 Halo PC). The design leverages SAPP's built-in capabilities to create a system that is efficient, consistent, and incredibly easy to maintain.

## The Problem: Managing 16 Servers the Naive Way

A typical approach would be to have 16 completely separate folders, each with its own:
*   Game executable (`haloceded.exe` or `haloded.exe`)
*   SAPP DLL and dependencies
*   Full set of config files (`admins.txt`, `users.txt`, `commands.txt`, etc.)
*   Map files
*   Save data

This leads to a nightmare of redundancy:
*   **Wasted Disk Space:** ~16 copies of the same 500MB+ map files and executables.
*   **Administrative Hell:** Adding an admin or banning a player requires manually doing the same action across 16 different servers. Inconsistency is inevitable.

## The Solution: Exploiting SAPP's Dual Folder Design

Our structure solves these problems by masterfully utilizing SAPP's intended separation between global and instance-specific configurations through a clever, hierarchical folder layout.

### Directory Structure Overview

```
C:\SERVERS\
├── CE/                          # Halo Custom Edition Server Root
│   ├── haloceded.exe            # **Shared Binary**
│   ├── sapp.dll                 # **Shared SAPP**
│   ├── maps/                    # **Shared Map Files**
│   ├── sapp/                    # **GLOBAL Config Hub**
│   │   ├── admins.txt           # <-- Unified Administration!

│       │       ├── init.txt     # Instance-specific SAPP config
│       │       ├── commands.txt # Game-mode specific commands
│       │       ├── mapcycle.txt # Game-mode specific rotation

│       │           └── divide_and_conquer.lua # Game-mode script
│       ├── gun_game/            # [Another Server Instance]
│       └── ... (6 more)
├── PC/                          # Halo PC Server Root (identical structure to CE)
└── server_launchers/
    ├── ce/
    │   ├── divide_and_conquer.bat # **Launch Scripts**
    │   └── ... (7 more)
    └── pc/
        └── ... (8 .bat files)
```

### How It Works: Masterful Use of SAPP's Design

The system's brilliance is in its explicit use of two dedicated `sapp` directories, each with a distinct purpose:

*   **Global Shared Configs (`/root/sapp/`):** This directory contains the administrative core that governs the entire server cluster. Files placed here are enforced across all servers sharing the same root (e.g., all 8 CE servers).
    *   `admins.txt`, `users.txt`, `ipbans.txt` → **Unified "Smart Ban" System**
    *   `areas.txt`, `locations.txt` → **Shared World Definitions**

*   **Instance-Specific Configs (`/root/cg/<server_name>/sapp/`):** This directory defines the unique personality of each individual server. Settings here affect only that specific game mode.
    *   `commands.txt`, `events.txt` → **Custom Commands & Hooks**
    *   `mapcycle.txt`, `mapvotes.txt` → **Unique Map Rotation & Voting**
    *   `lua/<script>.lua` → **Unique server-specific Lua scripts**

### Portable Configuration with Environment Variables

To enhance portability and simplify configuration, we use system environment variables to define the root server paths. This means the batch files don't need hardcoded paths, making the entire setup easily movable.

**Environment Variables Setup:**
- `HSP_CE_ROOT = C:\SERVERS\CE` (points to Custom Edition root)
- `HSP_PC_ROOT = C:\SERVERS\PC` (points to PC root)

The launch scripts are the glue that makes this work. Let's examine the updated batch file for the CE Divide and Conquer server (`server_launchers\ce\divide_and_conquer.bat`):

```batch
@ECHO OFF
set root=%HSP_CE_ROOT%
set path=%root%\cg\divide_and_conquer
set exec=%path%\init.txt
set port=2301
cd /d %root%
"%root%\haloceded.exe" -path %path% -exec %exec% -port %port%
```

The `-path %path%` parameter is the most important one. It tells the executable: **"Your working directory for this instance is `%HSP_CE_ROOT%\cg\divide_and_conquer`."**

This directive causes SAPP to:
1.  Load its instance-specific configuration from `%path%\sapp\` (e.g., `mapcycle.txt`).
2.  Inherently and simultaneously pull global, shared data from the `../sapp` folder relative to the executable's location for files like `admins.txt`.

This is not a fallback mechanism; it is a deliberate, fixed feature of SAPP that your structure leverages optimally. This clear separation is what makes your architecture not just clever, but **robust and professional**.

**Configuration Simplicity:** With this environment variable approach, configuring a new server batch file requires changing only two values:
1. The config directory name in the `path` variable
2. The port number

Example for a new server:
```batch
@ECHO OFF
set root=%HSP_CE_ROOT%
set path=%root%\cg\my_new_mode  # ← Only this changes
set exec=%path%\init.txt
set port=2302                   # ← And this changes if you need to modify the port
cd /d %root%
"%root%\haloceded.exe" -path %path% -exec %exec% -port %port%
```

### Key Benefits and Genius Practices

1.  **Unified Administration ("Smart Ban System"):**
    *   By placing `admins.txt`, `users.txt`, and `ipbans.txt` **only in the global root `sapp` directory**, we ensure they are shared across all servers.
    *   **Action:** Ban a player on one server.
    *   **Result:** They are instantly banned on all 8 servers on that platform. This is a huge deterrent for troublemakers and a massive administrative time-saver.

2.  **Efficient Disk Usage:**
    *   **No Redundancy:** Only one copy of the game executable, SAPP DLL, core dependencies, and map files exists per platform (CE/PC).
    *   **Saves ~8.5+ GB** compared to the naive 16-folder approach.

3.  **Effortless Maintenance and Updates:**
    *   **Update SAPP?** Just replace `sapp.dll` in the root folder. Done.
    *   **Add a new map?** Drop it in the root `maps/` folder. All servers can now use it.
    *   **Change a core admin setting?** Modify a file in the global `sapp` folder once.
    *   **Move installation location?** Simply update the `HSP_CE_ROOT` and `HSP_PC_ROOT` environment variables.

4.  **Perfect Isolation Where Needed:**
    *   Each server's game mode logic and map rotation are perfectly isolated in their own `cg/<mode>/` folder. Changing `gun_game`'s mapcycle has no effect on `divide_and_conquer`.
    *   This prevents conflicts and allows for total customization of each server's experience.

5.  **Clear and Organized Structure:**
    *   The layout is logical and intuitive. Anyone new to the project can understand the hierarchy and relationship between servers within minutes.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    - Create system environment variables `HSP_CE_ROOT` and `HSP_PC_ROOT` pointing to your server root directories
    - After creating these variables, restart any command prompts or applications that need to access them

2.  **Batch File Configuration:**
    - Use the template above for all server batch files
    - Only modify the config directory name and port number for each server
    - Place all batch files in the `server_launchers` directory organized by platform

3.  **Server Configuration:**
    - Place global admin/ban files in the root `sapp` directory
    - Place server-specific configs in each server's `cg/<server_name>/sapp/` directory
