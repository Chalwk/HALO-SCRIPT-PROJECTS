This is a basic, step-by-step tutorial that covers installing a Ubnutu-Linux VPS with Wine and a VNC server for remote connection, with a hosting company called Vultr. 

# Prerequisite applications:
- [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download) (for remote access to the terminal).
- [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64) (to upload files via FTP to the VPS).
- [TightVNC (client)](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) (for remote desktop connections)
- [Halo Server](https://github.com/Chalwk77/HALO-SCRIPT-PROJECTS/releases/tag/v1.0.7-Multi-Server)

Technical note on Vultr subscription plans:

You pay for whatever you need. However, you need at least 150 MiB *per server* to cover peak times. Multiply that by the number of servers you need and that'll tell you much you should expect to pay. Also note that each plan allocates you a defined amount of storage space. You may need more depending on how many maps you intend to upload.

## STEPS:
##### 1). Download and install [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64) and [TightVNC (client)](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php).

##### 2). Select Cloud Compute and install Ubuntu-Linux (version **21.10 x64**).

##### 3). Open BitVise SSH Client.
- Fill in the host & username (get from VPS control panel).
- Click login. 
- You will be prompted to accept and save a host key. Click accept and save. 
- Enter your password (get from VPS control panel).
- Click the "New Terminal Console" button.

##### 4). Enter the following commands (in order):

> Add multiarch support.
```none
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386*
```

> Add the WineHQ Ubuntu repository.
```none
wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
```

> Get and install the repository key.
```none
sudo -H gpg -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/winehq.key.gpg --dearmor winehq.key
```

> Add the repository.
```none
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ impish main'
```

> Update the package database.
```none
sudo apt update
```

> Install Wine.
```none
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
```

> Verify the installation has succeeded.
```none
wine --version
```

#### 5). Installing TightVNC Server.

> The graphical environment is not installed by default on server versions of Ubuntu.
> Therefore, if we want to connect to a remote desktop, we need to install a graphical shell.
> Letâ€™s install the TightVNC Server itself at the same time.
```none
apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tightvncserver
```

> Start the TightVNC Server for the first time. It will create the files necessary for work and ask to create a password.
> If you need to restrict remote desktop control, select a read-only password.
```none
vncserver
```

> Now stop your TightVNC session to adjust other settings.
```none
vncserver -kill :1
```

> Open the TightVNC config file with.
```none
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

> Add the following line to the end.
```none
startxfce4
```

#### 6). Setting up autorun.
> By default, TightVNC does not have a daemon and does not turn on after a system reboot. To fix this, let's create a new unit in systemd.
```none
nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver.service*
```

> Insert the following config there:

```none
[Unit]
Description=TightVNC server
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=root
PAMName=login
PIDFile=/root/.vnc/%H:1.pid
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :1 > /dev/null 2>&1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver
ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Reload systemd:
```none
systemctl daemon-reload
```

> Enable autorun of the TightVNC server and start it.
```none
systemctl enable --now vncserver
```

#### 7). Set up UFW (firewall)
> Firstly, you need to sudo-allow port 5901/tcp for incoming VNC connections:
```none
- ufw allow 5901/tcp
```
> Then sudo-allow UDP connections for Halo on ports 2302, 2303 and your server port(s), with:
```none
sudo ufw allow 2302/udp
sudo ufw allow 2303/udp
sudo ufw allow 2310/udp
sudo ufw allow 2311/udp
sudo ufw allow 2312/udp
```

> Thirdly, you can optionally sudo-allow your IP Address and reject all others:
> This will make it so that only the specified IPs can connect to the vnc server.
```none
sudo ufw allow from 0.0.0.0* (replace 0.0.0.0 with your own ipv4 address)
```
> Then sudo-reject all other inbound connections and enable the UFW:
```none
sudo ufw default reject incoming
```
```none
- sudo ufw enable
```

## 8). Upload the **HPC Multi-Server** folder to */root/Desktop*
