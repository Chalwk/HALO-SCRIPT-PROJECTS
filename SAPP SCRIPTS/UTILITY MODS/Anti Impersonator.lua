Script Name: AntiImpersonator for SAPP (PC & CE)
Description: Prevent other players from impersonating your community members.

-------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE
-------------------------

* Shared Hashes and Dynamic IPs:

If a community member has a shared hash or uses a dynamic IP address, this system may not work effectively for them.

Shared Hashes: Some players may share the same hash (e.g., cracked/pirated account), which means
               multiple legitimate users might have the same hash. This could lead to false positives,
               where one player is mistakenly flagged as an impersonator.

Dynamic IPs: If a memberâ€™s IP address changes frequently (e.g., due to using dynamic IPs provided by their ISP),
             the system could mistakenly flag players as impersonators if their IP address
             doesn't match the one originally listed for them.

To Protect a Community Member:
    1. Static IP:
        If possible, ensure that the member uses a static IP address. This will allow their IP to remain consistent and reliably be recognized as theirs.

    2. Legitimate Hash:
        If the member uses a legitimate, unique player hash, that will be more reliable than relying on IP alone.
        Player hashes are more consistent and tied to their specific Halo account, so they are less prone to change than IP addresses.
