# 👾 Halo Script Projects (HSP)

Hi there! I'm **Chalwk**, a passionate independent game developer and open-source enthusiast from New Zealand. You'll find me engaged in various coding projects, spanning from software engineering and research & development to creative coding.

## 🚀 What is HSP?

The **HSP (Halo Script Projects)** GitHub repository is the platform where I upload all my Lua scripts for **SAPP** and **Phasor**.

### What are SAPP & Phasor?
> Powerful server extensions for the Halo: PC (retail) and Halo: CE (Custom Edition) dedicated servers.

I have been writing Lua scripts for Halo since around **2009**, creating everything from custom games and utilities to libraries and server enhancements.
