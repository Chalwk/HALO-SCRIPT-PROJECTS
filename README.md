# üëæ **Halo Script Projects (HSP)**

Welcome to the **Halo Script Projects (HSP)** repository! I'm **Chalwk**, an independent game developer and open-source enthusiast from New Zealand. Here, you'll find a collection of Lua scripts, tools, and resources for **Halo: PC (Retail)** and **Halo: Custom Edition (CE)** dedicated servers. Whether you're a server admin, modder, or just a Halo fan, this repository is your one-stop shop for enhancing your Halo experience.

## üöÄ **What is HSP?**

The **HSP (Halo Script Projects)** repository is where I upload all my Lua scripts for **SAPP** and **Phasor**, two powerful server extensions for Halo dedicated servers.

### **What are SAPP & Phasor?**
> SAPP and Phasor are server extensions that allow for advanced customization of Halo: PC and Halo: CE dedicated servers. They enable features like custom game modes, server utilities, and enhanced gameplay mechanics through Lua scripting.

I‚Äôve been writing Lua scripts for Halo since **2009**, creating everything from custom games and utilities to libraries and server enhancements. This repository is a culmination of my passion for Halo and game development.
