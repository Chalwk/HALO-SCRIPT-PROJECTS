# 👾 Halo Script Projects (HSP)

Welcome to the **Halo Script Projects (HSP)** repository! I'm **Chalwk**, an independent game developer and open-source enthusiast from New Zealand. I've been writing Lua scripts for Halo since **2009**, creating everything from custom game modes and server tools to libraries and quality-of-life enhancements.

This repo contains a curated collection of Lua scripts, utilities, and resources for **Halo: PC (Retail)** and **Halo: Custom Edition (CE)** dedicated servers. If you're a server admin or operator using **SAPP** or **Phasor**, you'll find a wide range of scripts here to enhance, customize, and extend your multiplayer server experience.

### **💡 What are SAPP & Phasor?**

> **SAPP** and **Phasor** are server-side extensions that provide advanced scripting and customization for **Halo: PC** and **Halo: CE** dedicated servers.
>
> **SAPP**, developed and maintained by **sehé** ([halo.isimaginary.com](http://halo.isimaginary.com)), is the most feature-rich and widely used extension. It provides powerful Lua scripting support, anti-cheat tools, event hooks, command handling, player management, logging, and countless under-the-hood features.
>
> **Phasor** was an earlier server extension with similar goals. Though no longer actively maintained, it remains compatible with many scripts and still sees use in some legacy setups.
