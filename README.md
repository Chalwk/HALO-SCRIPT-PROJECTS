Hi there. I'm Chalwk, a passionate independent game developer and open-source enthusiast from New Zealand. You'll find
me doing various coding projects, from software engineering through research and development to creative coding.

The HSP (Halo Script Projects) GitHub repository is the platform to which I upload all of my Lua scripts for SAPP and
Phasor.

**What is SAPP & Phasor?**
> Powerful server extensions for the Halo: PC (retail) and Halo: CE (Custom Edition) dedicated server.

I have been writing Lua scripts for 13 years; Making everything from custom games, utilities, libraries and other server
additives.
