* Disability
* Ethnicity
* Gender identity and expression
* Level of experience

Anyone who wishes to contribute is expected to uphold these same standards.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information (e.g., a physical or electronic address) without explicit permission

## Maintainer‚Äôs Responsibilities

As the sole maintainer of this project, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. I may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by me, the project maintainer.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at **[jericho.crosby227@gmail.com](mailto:jericho.crosby227@gmail.com)**.

Reports will be reviewed and investigated, and I will respond in a manner deemed appropriate to the circumstances. Confidentiality will be maintained regarding the reporter of an incident.

If I fail to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith, contributors are free to stop participating in or supporting the project.
